# RMC Docker Environment Setup

This repository provides a simple and complete starting point for working with ROS2 on a Raspberry Pi. By following the steps in this README, you will be able to:

- Install all required applications  
- Launch a Docker container with a pre-configured ROS2 environment  
- Follow a step-by-step guide starting from a fresh Raspberry Pi setup  

---

## üì• Step 1: Clone the Repository

> **Note**: If you do not have `git` installed yet, download the repository manually from the following link:  
> https://github.com/mariame42/RMC_docker

Once downloaded, you will find the following files and folders:

- `README.md`: This guide  
- `Dockerfile`: Defines the ROS2 environment used inside the Docker container  
- `setup.sh`: Installs necessary software on the local machine  
- `clone_roamio.sh`: clone the main repos for roamio
- `notes/`  
  - `docker/`: Items or additions related to the Docker setup  
  - `script/`: Items or additions related to the setup script  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Run the Setup Script

Navigate to the folder where you saved the repository and run the setup script:

```bash
cd /path/to/RMC_docker
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

---

## üê≥ Step 3: Build and Run the Docker Container

### Terminal Method

Use the following commands to build and run the Docker container:

```bash
cd /path/to/RMC_docker
sudo docker build -t mariame42/ros2_jazzy_env:arm64 .
sudo docker run -it \
    --name ros2_container \
    -v /:/host \
    mariame42/ros2_jazzy_env:arm64 \
    /bin/bash
```

---

---

## üîÅ Step 4 Clone Roamio Repositories (Optional)

To get the Roamio robot code and documentation, run the following script:

```bash
chmod +x clone_roamio.sh
./clone_roamio.sh
```

### VS Code Method (Dev Containers)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure the container is **not already running** before using this method.

1. Install the following VS Code extensions:
   - `Docker`
   - `Dev Containers`

2. Create your development directory:

```bash
mkdir ~/ros2_dev
cd ~/ros2_dev
```

3. Create and configure the Dev Container:

```bash
mkdir .devcontainer
cd .devcontainer
nano devcontainer.json
```

4. Paste the following content into the `devcontainer.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "ROS2 Jazzy Dev",
  "image": "mariame42/ros2_jazzy_env:arm64",
  "runArgs": [
    "--name", "ros2_container",
    "-v", "/:/host"
  ],
  "settings": {
    "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "bash"
  }
}
```

## üß© Step 3: Open It in VS Code

1. Open **VS Code**

2. Go to:  
   **File ‚Üí Open Folder ‚Üí Select `~/ros2_dev`**

3. Press `F1` (or `Ctrl+Shift+P`)

4. Type:  
   **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**

5. Select that option from the dropdown


Save the file and open the folder in VS Code. You will be prompted to reopen in the container.

You're all set! This environment should give you a stable ROS2 setup tailored for your robot development needs on Raspberry Pi.
